# Reworking project with Simple React + Vite

### Some Features in this Project are:

##### 1. UI is made with Fake JSON Data.

##### 2. Clean code and easy to understand structure is maintained.

##### 3. EventHandler Added By using prop-drilling method.

In this project I managed my state by using useState hook provided by react library, which helps us to maintain the states of components.
Another fun part of this project is using useEffect hook for fetching data from the local JSON, Which is used in this project. The prop-drilling method is old but it is part of learning react process which i'm glad that i have cleared that part.
